# Game Idea Machine
A twitter bot which tweets randomly generated ideas for games.

Occasionally funny, often bizarre, hopefully useful.

Will reply with an idea if you tweet "@gameideamachine [command]", where [command] is one of:

* __idea__ - a totally random idea from any category
* __sim__ - a sim/tycoon/board game
* __action__ - an action/shooter type game
* __adventure__ - an RPG/adventure game
* __indie__ - an arty/indie game
* __mashup__ - a suggestion referencing existing games
* __weapon__ - an idea centered around a weapon of some sort
* __setting__ - an idea focused on the setting
* __character__ - a game based on a particular character

Comments and suggestions should be tweeted to [@beeglebug](http://twitter.com/beeglebug)
