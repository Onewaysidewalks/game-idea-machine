# Game Idea Machine
A twitter bot which tweets randomly generated ideas for games.

Occasionally funny, often bizarre, hopefully useful.

Will reply with an idea if you tweet "@gameideamachine [command]", where [command] is one of:

idea - a totally random idea from any category
sim - a sim/tycoon/board game
action - an action/shooter type game
adventure - an RPG/adventure game
indie - an arty/indie game
mashup - a suggestion referencing existing games
weapon - an idea centered around a weapon of some sort
setting - an idea focused on the setting
character - a game based on a particular character

Comments and suggestions can be tweeted to [@gameideamachine](http://twitter.com/gameideamachine)
